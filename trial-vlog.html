        <h3 class="heading">My First Journey To Shillong</h3>
        <small>Author: <span class="author-name">Noob Traveller Imtiaz</span></small>
        <p>Shillong is a hill station and the capital of Meghalaya, a state in northeastern India. It is the
            headquarters of
            the East Khasi Hills district. Shillong is the 330th most populous city in India with a population of
            143,229
            according to the 2011 census.[7] It is said that the rolling hills around the town reminded the British
            of
            Scotland. Hence, they would also refer to it as the "Scotland of the East".[8]

            Shillong has steadily grown in size since it was made the civil station of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills
            in
            1864
            by the British. In 1874, on the formation of Assam as the Chief Commissioner's Province, it was chosen
            as
            the
            headquarters of the new administration because of its convenient location between the Brahmaputra and
            Surma
            valleys and more so because the climate of Shillong was much cooler than tropical India.[9] Shillong
            remained
            the capital of undivided Assam until the creation of the new state of Meghalaya on 21 January 1972, when
            Shillong became the capital of Meghalaya, and Assam moved its capital to Dispur in Guwahati.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">My Second Journey To Debotakhum Bandarban</h3>
        <small>Author: <span class="author-name">Noob Traveller Imtiaz</span></small>
        <p>Devtakhum is a place of natural beauty in Bandarban district . Clear water flows here between the high
            mountains
            on both sides. It is an attractive place for tourists.Devtakhum is located in Rowangchhari Upazila of
            Bandarban
            District.According to the locals of Bandarban it is about 50 feet deep and about 600 feet long. [1]
            Close to
            it
            is Shilbandha Jharna. There are huge forests on both sides of this khum. Because of the steep hills,
            direct
            sunlight does not reach inside the khum. So Khum feels cooler the further you go inside. The place is
            very
            quiet
            and noise free. Its water is also very clear. Going inside these khums on a bamboo raft gives the
            tourists a
            thrilling feeling, which will easily make anyone fall in love with nature.From Bandarban town you have
            to
            come
            to Rowanchari first. From Rowangchari, permission has to be obtained from Kachchapatli Bazar at Liragaon
            cantonment. From there you can go to Shilbandha Para by trekking for an hour. Devtakhum is near
            Shilbandha
            Para.
            But before Devtakhum another khum called Pong Su Ang has to be crossed. [1] This Khum trekking route
            becomes
            somewhat impassable during monsoons. It is not safe to go here during monsoons or any other time without
            a
            guide. If you don't know how to swim, you should wear a life jacket before entering the water.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">My Third Journey To Cox's Bazar</h3>
        <small>Author: <span class="author-name">Noob Traveller Imtiaz</span></small>
        <p>Cox's Bazar is a city, fishing port, tourism centre, and district headquarters in southeastern
            Bangladesh.
            Cox's
            Bazar Beach, one of the most popular tourist attractions in Bangladesh, is the longest uninterrupted
            natural
            beach in the world.[1][2] Located 150 km (93 mi) south of the city of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar is also
            known
            by
            the name Panowa, which translates literally as "yellow flower." An old name was "Palongkee". Kutupalong
            refugee
            camp, the world's largest refugee camp, is in Cox's Bazar.[3][4]

            The city covers an area of 23.4 km2 (9.0 sq mi) with 58 mahallas and 27 wards and as of 2022 had a
            population of
            nearly 200,000.[5] Cox's Bazar is connected by road and air with Chittagong.[6][7]

            The modern Cox's Bazar derives its name from Captain Hiram Cox, an officer of the British East India
            Company, a
            Superintendent of Palongkee outpost. To commemorate his role in refugee rehabilitation work, a market
            was
            established and named after him. It is one of Bangladesh's main tourist spots. In 2023 Bangladesh
            evacuated
            over
            50,000 people to safe shelters as Cyclone Mocha approached.[8]</p>
